# WOPR/Joshua

## Overview

In the movie Wargames, David (Matthew Broderick) attempts to hack into a software company's mainframe in order to pirate some new computer games. Inadvertently, he connects to a simulator used by the US military called the War Operations Planned Response, or WOPR.

WOPR was originally developed by Professor Falken as a series of games meant to teach a computer to think strategically. Developing the System was also a way to interact with his son, Joshua, who unfortunately died. The backdoor password into WOPR was the name Joshua, and also the name by which David and Professor Falken identified the System.

In the movie, when David first successfully connected to WOPR/Joshua, he discovered he could speak to it like it was an intelligent being. This program recreates that interaction.

## Program
## LOGON

While cryptic, the System asks for the logon password to enter the System. Any incorrect input is not recognized by the System and the connection is terminated.

## Greetings

Once the correct password (joshua) in entered, the System greets you.

In order to better recreate the interaction from the movie there is a slight pause between the user input and the System response.

## It's been a long time

In keeping with the movie, when the System asks for an explanation about the removal of your user account, it is looking for a specific word (mistakes) in the response to continue.

Incorrect responses terminate the connection.

## Shall we play a game?

As above, when the System asks to play a game, it is looking for a specific phrase (global thermonuclear war) in the response.

The same phrase is needed in the next interaction as well.

## Fine

The end of the program.
