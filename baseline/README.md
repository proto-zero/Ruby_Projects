# Baseline

## Overview

In the movie Blade Runner 2047, our hero, K (Ryan Gosling), is a Replicant and the titular Blade Runner, a cop who hunts down rogue Replicants with extreme prejudice.

Upon returning to the precinct, K is put through a rapid series of questions in order to determine where he is at psychologically after hunting his own kind, referred to as his baseline.

The lines recited in the test are from the novel Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov.

## Program

In the movie K is judged not only on his ability to recite the baseline test but on factors like tone of voice, pulse, sweat, and eye focus. This program only tests the ability of the testee to recite the baseline correctly.

As the test progresses it keeps score. If by the midpoint the score hasn't reached a high enough value then the test changes to a new set of questions. The ending changes depending on the total score.
